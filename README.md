# AI Landing Page Builder

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## 1. System Architecture

Built using the Next.js framework, the application benefits from:

- Server-side rendering (SSR) capabilities.
- Simplified routing.
- Seamless API route handling.

React powers the user interfaces, while TailwindCSS offers styling flexibility. GrapesJS plays a pivotal role in dynamically generating and editing the landing page components using a drag and drop interface.

## 2. User Interface

### Initial Screen

The first screen features a simple form with:

- Two text fields
- A file upload option to allow users to upload a PDF.

The form layout is optimized for usability, ensuring that users can easily understand and interact with it.

## 3. Data Flow

### Initial Screen

The first screen features a simple form with:

- A file upload option to allow users to upload a PDF.

The form layout is optimized for usability, ensuring that users can easily understand and interact with it.

## 4. GrapesJS Integration:

The data received from the backend is matched with predefined JSON objects. These objects contain the necessary specifications for building GrapesJS components.

TailwindCSS, known for its utility-first approach, is used to style these components. This ensures that the landing pages are not only functional but also visually appealing.

## 5. AI Image and Copy Generation:

The application integrates with OpenAI APIs to achieve AI-powered image and copy generation within the GrapesJS editor.

Process:

1. API Calls: Using Next.js API routes, the system handles calls to the OpenAI APIs.

2. Copy Generation: Extracted data is used to prompt OpenAI's model to generate relevant and engaging content for the landing page.

3. Image Generation: In addition to textual content, the AI can generate or suggest relevant images to enhance the landing page's visual appeal.

## 6. Deployment and Hosting

As the application is built on Next.js, it can easily be deployed on platforms like Vercel or Netlify. These platforms provide seamless deployment processes and automatic updates whenever changes are pushed to the source repository.

## 7. Saving and Publishing the final webpage

Once you've achieved your desired landing page design, our AI Landing Page Builder offers the option to seamlessly save both the final HTML of the page and the JSON schema representing the webpage's structure and content. This feature integrates directly with Contentful, a renowned headless Content Management System (CMS), providing a streamlined method for content storage, retrieval, and subsequent editing.

## Conclusion

The AI Landing Page Builder is a revolutionary tool that streamlines the landing page creation process. With the power of AI and a robust tech stack like React, Next.js, GrapesJS, and TailwindCSS, users can create stunning landing pages with minimal effort.

Integrating the ability to save to Contentful adds a layer of efficiency and flexibility to the AI Landing Page Builder. By storing both the final HTML and the JSON schema, users can ensure that their content remains agile, future-proof, and ready for any platform.
